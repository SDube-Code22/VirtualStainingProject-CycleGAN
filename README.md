Traditional histological staining methods are known to be tissue-distorting, costly and time-consuming task. And yet, with increase in demand for cheaper, faster and equitable healthcare access, the utilisation of deep learning as an alternative in medical imaging presents a promising approach that overcomes the said challenges. In this project, we implemented a Cycle GAN model to learn the staining task between on 6968 stained and unstained images sourced from the Breast Cancer Immunohistochemical (BCI) dataset (Liu et al., 2022). The trained model was then used to stain 977 unstained images. 20 hand-picked generated images were qualitatively evaluated by experts through a survey who reported that they appeared decent with the correct colours being translated however the resolution was low. The images had a Kernel Inception Score (KID) of 0.20, a decreased cell count by 96.34% and increased cell size by 55.43%. The expert evaluation showed that there was a 50% chance of mistaking the generated images for real images. There was a high stain fidelity and colour realism, but with low diagnostic confidence and nuclear detailing. This showed that there is still promising progress and room to improve the use of deep learning for histology staining in modern healthcare.
